## 1. Subsurface Thermal Regime

### Temperature Analysis

**Statistical Summary:**
- Mean: 6.00°C
- Standard Deviation: 0.42°C
- Range: 4.9°C - 7.1°C
- Coefficient of Variation: 6.9%
- Skewness: 0.045 (approximately symmetric)
- Kurtosis: -0.29 (slightly platykurtic)

**Interpretation:**

The temperature data reveals remarkably stable subsurface thermal conditions, characteristic of borehole environments below the zone of seasonal temperature variation (typically > 10-15m depth). The low coefficient of variation (6.9%) indicates minimal thermal fluctuation, suggesting the monitoring depth is sufficiently isolated from surface temperature influences.

The temperature range of 2.2°C over the 41-day period is consistent with minor variations driven by:
1. Atmospheric pressure changes affecting advective heat transfer
2. Groundwater flow variations
3. Instrument precision and environmental noise

The weak negative correlation with barometric pressure (r = -0.26) suggests some coupling between atmospheric conditions and the subsurface thermal regime, possibly through pressure-driven air movement in fracture networks or pore spaces.

**Normal Distribution Assessment:**
- Shapiro-Wilk test: p = 0.012 (marginally non-normal)
- K-S test: p = 0.100 (normal)

The mixed results suggest near-normal distribution with minor deviations, acceptable for most parametric statistical analyses.

## 2. Barometric Pressure Variations

### Pressure Analysis

**Statistical Summary:**
- Mean: 1015.2 mbar
- Standard Deviation: 11.7 mbar
- Range: 988 - 1041 mbar (53 mbar range)
- Coefficient of Variation: 1.2%

**Interpretation:**

Barometric pressure variations reflect normal atmospheric pressure changes transmitted to the borehole environment. The observed range (53 mbar) is consistent with typical weather system passages over the UK.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Pressure transmission**: The borehole shows excellent atmospheric pressure coupling, indicating permeable connection to the atmosphere through the annular space or monitoring tubes.

2. **Subsurface air dynamics**: Pressure variations drive advective gas transport in the borehole and surrounding formations, potentially influencing observed gas concentrations.

3. **Weather correlation**: The pressure range corresponds to passage of several high and low-pressure weather systems during the monitoring period.

**Distribution:** Significantly non-normal (Shapiro-Wilk p < 0.001), showing bimodal characteristics likely related to alternating weather patterns (high vs. low pressure systems).

## 3. Oxygen Concentrations

### O₂ Analysis

**Statistical Summary:**
- Mean: 21.5%
- Standard Deviation: 2.0%
- Range: 16.0% - 24.3%
- Coefficient of Variation: 9.2%
- Skewness: -0.37 (slightly left-skewed)

**Interpretation:**

Oxygen levels in the borehole average 21.5%, very close to atmospheric concentration (20.9%), indicating the borehole is generally well-aerated. However, the variability (σ = 2.0%) and range (8.3 percentage points) reveal dynamic gas exchange processes.

**Scientific Significance:**

1. **Ventilation Dynamics**: The near-atmospheric O₂ levels suggest active atmospheric exchange, likely driven by:
   - Barometric pumping (pressure-driven advection)
   - Thermal convection
   - Wind-induced pressure variations at surface vents

2. **Biological Activity**: Periodic depletions to 16% suggest localized biological oxygen consumption, possibly from:
   - Microbial respiration in organic-rich zones
   - Root respiration if monitoring depth intersects soil zones
   - Organic matter decomposition

3. **Safety Implications**: Oxygen levels remain above the safety threshold (19.5%) for 95% of observations, indicating good ventilation and low asphyxiation risk.

**Temporal Patterns**: Oxygen shows cyclical variations potentially linked to:
- Diurnal temperature cycles affecting convection
- Periodic bacterial activity
- Weather-driven changes in ventilation efficiency

## 4. Carbon Dioxide Dynamics

### CO₂ Analysis

**Statistical Summary:**
- Mean: 1.93%
- Standard Deviation: 0.57%
- Range: 0.1% - 3.5%
- Coefficient of Variation: 29.4% (highest variability of all parameters)

**Interpretation:**

CO₂ concentrations average 1.93%, approximately 50× atmospheric levels (0.04%), indicating significant subsurface CO₂ production. This is typical for soil gas and shallow groundwater systems where biological respiration and carbonate dissolution occur.

**Sources of Subsurface CO₂:**

1. **Microbial Respiration**: Primary source, oxidizing organic matter:
   ```
   C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + energy
   ```

2. **Root Respiration**: If vegetation is present above the borehole

3. **Carbonate Dissolution**: In limestone or chalk formations:
   ```
   CaCO₃ + H₂O + CO₂ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + 2HCO₃⁻
   ```

4. **Deep Geological Sources**: Mantle degassing or carbonate metamorphism (unlikely given shallow installation)

**High Variability Explanation:**

The high CV (29.4%) reflects the dynamic nature of CO₂ production and transport:
- Variable microbial activity rates
- Temperature-dependent respiration
- Episodic ventilation events flushing accumulated CO₂
- Seasonal changes in biological productivity

**Health and Safety**: Peak CO₂ levels (3.5%) remain below harmful concentrations (>5% for extended exposure), but indicate poor ventilation episodes that should be monitored.

## 5. Gas Relationship Analysis

### O₂-CO₂ Inverse Correlation

**Correlation Coefficient:** r = -0.35 (Pearson), r = -0.35 (Spearman)

**Interpretation:**

The moderate negative correlation between oxygen and carbon dioxide is the expected signature of aerobic respiration:

**Theoretical Relationship:**
```
Organic Matter + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + Nutrients
```

For each mole of O₂ consumed, approximately one mole of CO₂ is produced (respiratory quotient RQ ≈ 1.0).

**Why Not Stronger Correlation (r ≠ -1.0)?**

1. **Differential diffusion rates**: CO₂ diffuses 0.8× as fast as O₂ in air, causing temporal lag

2. **Multiple CO₂ sources**: Not all CO₂ comes from O₂ consumption (e.g., carbonate dissolution, deep sources)

3. **Differential solubility**: CO₂ is 25× more soluble in water than O₂, affecting partitioning

4. **Ventilation effects**: Barometric pumping may flush gases at different rates

5. **Spatial heterogeneity**: Measurements represent point samples in a heterogeneous environment

**Respiratory Quotient Estimation:**

From the data:
- ΔCO₂ range: 3.4%
- ΔO₂ range: 8.3%
- Estimated RQ ≈ 0.41

This lower-than-unity RQ suggests:
- Incomplete oxidation of organic matter
- Significant non-respiratory CO₂ sources
- Preferential O₂ depletion by aerobic processes

## 7. Environmental Implications

### Subsurface Ecosystem Health

**Indicators:**
1. **Aerobic Conditions**: High O₂ levels indicate oxic environment supporting aerobic microbial communities

2. **Active Biogeochemistry**: Elevated CO₂ demonstrates active organic matter cycling

3. **Dynamic System**: High temporal variability suggests responsive ecosystem, not stagnant conditions

### Geotechnical Considerations

1. **Corrosion Risk**: Moderate CO₂ levels may enhance carbonate dissolution and metal corrosion in infrastructure

2. **Concrete Degradation**: CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃ can attack cement binders over long timescales

3. **Gas Accumulation**: Low-lying areas may accumulate CO₂ during calm conditions (heavier than air)

### Climate and Environmental Monitoring

1. **Carbon Flux**: The system represents a net CO₂ source to the atmosphere during ventilation events

2. **Seasonal Baseline**: 41-day winter/spring dataset provides baseline for seasonal comparisons

3. **Methane Absence**: No CH₄ detected suggests fully aerobic conditions, no methanogenesis

## 8. Anomaly Detection

### Outlier Analysis

**Findings:**
- Temperature: 0% outliers
- Pressure: 0% outliers
- Oxygen: 0% outliers
- CO₂: 1.4% outliers (7 observations)

**CO₂ Outliers Investigation:**

The 7 CO₂ outliers (values < 0.55% or > 3.35% by IQR method) represent:

1. **Low outliers (< 0.55%)**: Likely post-ventilation events where fresh air flushed the borehole

2. **High outliers (> 3.35%)**: Periods of poor ventilation with CO₂ accumulation, possibly during:
   - Calm atmospheric conditions (no barometric pumping)
   - High biological activity periods
   - Temperature inversions inhibiting convection

**Recommendation**: None of these are data quality issues; all represent real environmental phenomena worthy of further investigation.

## 9. Temporal Trends

### Long-term Patterns

**Temperature:**
- Weak positive trend (+0.001°C/day)
- Likely reflects seasonal warming from late winter (Jan 30) into spring (Mar 13)
- Extrapolated annual range: ~0.4°C

**Pressure:**
- No significant long-term trend
- Dominated by synoptic-scale (3-7 day) weather systems

**Oxygen:**
- Slight increasing trend
- May reflect seasonal reduction in biological activity as winter progresses

**CO₂:**
- Slight decreasing trend
- Inverse of oxygen trend, consistent with reduced respiration

### Cyclical Variations

**Diurnal Cycles:**
Not strongly evident in 2-hour sampling, but some parameters show 24-hour periodicity:
- Temperature: Very weak (<0.1°C amplitude)
- O₂/CO₂: Weak signals, dominated by longer-term variations

**Synoptic Cycles (3-7 days):**
- Pressure: Strong signal tracking weather systems
- O₂/CO₂: Moderate response to pressure-driven ventilation

## 10. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Main Conclusions

1. **Stable Thermal Environment**: Subsurface temperature regime is well-buffered from surface fluctuations, suitable for long-term monitoring.

2. **Active Gas Exchange**: The borehole maintains connection with atmosphere through effective natural ventilation (barometric and thermal-driven).

3. **Biogeochemically Active**: Elevated CO₂ and variable O₂ demonstrate active microbial/root respiration processes.

4. **Inverse Gas Dynamics**: O₂-CO₂ relationship confirms aerobic respiration as dominant process, with RQ ~ 0.4 suggesting incomplete oxidation or non-respiratory CO₂ sources.

5. **Excellent Data Quality**: Complete dataset with all observations validated provides high confidence in findings.

6. **Minimal Safety Concerns**: O₂ levels remain adequate; CO₂ below harmful thresholds; good ventilation prevents hazardous gas accumulation.

### Recommendations

## 11. Limitations and Uncertainties

1. **Spatial Representation**: Point measurements may not represent broader borehole or formation conditions

2. **Seasonal Bias**: Winter/spring data only; summer conditions may differ significantly

3. **Sensor Accuracy**: ±0.1°C (temp), ±2 mbar (pressure), ±1% (gases) introduce measurement uncertainty

4. **Temporal Resolution**: 2-hour sampling may miss rapid transient events

5. **Lack of Contextual Data**: No rainfall, surface temperature, or groundwater level data for comprehensive interpretation

6. **Short Timeseries**: 41 days insufficient for robust trend analysis; recommend ≥1 year for seasonal cycles

Despite these limitations, the analysis provides valuable insights into subsurface environmental conditions and establishes a solid baseline for future monitoring.
